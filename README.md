# Description
**Miora** empowers every shopper—whether they prefer AI automation by providing an image or manual control—to create a hyper-realistic 3D avatar and virtually try on fashion with pinpoint accuracy and privacy. Users can upload a selfie or use on-device 3D scanning to generate their digital twin, or manually enter/adjust height, weight, chest/waist/hip circumferences, limb lengths and posture via a real-time visualizer that flags inconsistencies. Once the avatar is perfected, Miora’s cloth-simulation engine drapes garments uploaded by URL or image as they would in real life, and AI-driven fit recommendations use brand size charts. All biometric data is encrypted locally; shoppers enjoy social sharing, studio-grade lighting and offline access, while brands get anonymized analytics on returns, fit accuracy and style trends.
